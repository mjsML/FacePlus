These weights are trained from scratch via [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/).

These weights are for MobileFaceNet and have accuracy of 0.99317 on lfw and accuracy of 0.90800 on cfp_fp

The authors of InsightFace in their work [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01936.pdf)[[2]](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Model-Zoo) were able to achieve 0.9950 and 0.8894 respectively on the same datasets.

The current best result on cfp_fp is held by VarGNet with accuracy of 0.89829 on mobile architectures[[3]](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/face-recognition-on-cfp-fp)
