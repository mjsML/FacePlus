These weights are trained from scratch via [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/).

These weights have Normalized Mean Error of 0.024501 on AFLW2000-3D.

The authors of InsightFace in their work [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01936.pdf)[[2]](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/alignment) were able to achieve NME of 0.0307 on the same dataset.
